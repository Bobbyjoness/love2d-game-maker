WARNING: The following file is full of legal gibberish we're legally required to add in order to protect our software.
If all you want to do is make games.. don't worry about it! YOUR games made with Love Game Maker ARE YOURS and as such can
be licensed or distributed in any way you please! You can even sell them if you'd like! Just don't mess with the licenses
in the included LÖVE framework (Which Love Game maker uses to build your games.) and you'll be fine. ;)


If a "license.txt" file is found within a directory, that license applies to all files in that directory. Changing the file/folder
structure from default, of course, does not change which licenses apply to which files.

All files that do not have a "license.txt" file in their directory in the state of install fall under the following
non-commercial variation of the MIT license contained within the apostrophes:
