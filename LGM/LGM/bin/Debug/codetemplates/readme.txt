What are these? Glad you asked!

Since Love Game Maker was designed to be as flexible as possible while still being easy for
new-comers, I went out of my way to program it so you can edit the way the program generates
code simply by messing with these files!

A full guide for editing these files will be avaliable on the wiki shortly.
In the meantime, why don't you try messing with them on your own? :)
