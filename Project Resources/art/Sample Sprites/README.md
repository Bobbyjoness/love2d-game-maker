Here's the place to put any sample sprites you make that kids can use in their games without fear of copyright! They must be released under public domain and be
"kid friendly." Thanks! :)

What are sprites, you ask? Sprites are essentially images used by video games for "things." A good example of this is Super Mario Bros. In that game, mario,
the enemies, the coins, the breakable bricks, the question mark blocks, etc. are all sprites!

The difference between sprites and backgrounds is that sprites are typically smaller and meant to be drawn to the front of the screen, while backgrounds are
typically very large and are meant to be used as, well, the background.
