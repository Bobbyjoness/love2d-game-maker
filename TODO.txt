This file details the next few important tasks that need to be done to the project.
IT DOES NOT DETAIL ALL THE THINGS THAT MUST BE DONE!!!

Must add the ability to add objects which generate code (Though we're luckily extremely close to that with my new type-based resource system. :D)
Must add the resource editors. (Such as the sound editors, background editors, etc.) Temporarially styling the project off of Game Maker. So, if you don't know what to make it look like... well, make it look like that. :P

Lots of other things
